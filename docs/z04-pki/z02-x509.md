Let's now take a look at how you can generate certificates

## Creating roles

Like other dynamic secret engines to generate secrets you need to create a
roll that defines what the generated secret will look like

The following role allows you to generate a certificates that will have a 
common name which is any subdomain of the self signed CA `demo.gs` that was
created in the previous step.

The TTL or the max duration that a certificate is valid for will be `72 hours`.

Run this command now and configure your role.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>
    vault write pki/roles/demo-gs \
        allowed_domains=demo.gs \
        allow_subdomains=true max_ttl=72h
  </Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault write pki/roles/demo-gs \
    allowed_domains=demo.gs \
    allow_subdomains=true max_ttl=72h
```

## Generating certificates

Now the role has been configured you can use this to generate a certificate
this is done by `writing` to the path `pki/issue/demo-gs`.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>
    vault write pki/issue/demo-gs \
      common_name=test.demo.gs
  </Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
  vault write pki/issue/demo-gs \
    common_name=test.demo.gs
```

You will see that Vault outputs something like the following example. When
generating a certificate you will receive not only the certificate and
its corresponding private key, but also the CA chain that was used to
sign it.

```shell
Key                 Value

```

Let's run another command to extract just the certificate so that you can 
inspect what is going on.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>
    vault write --format=json pki/issue/demo-gs \
      common_name=test.demo.gs \
      | jq -r '.data.certificate' \
      > test-demo-gs.pem
  </Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault write --format=json pki/issue/demo-gs \
  common_name=test.demo.gs \
  | jq -r '.data.certificate' \
  > test-demo-gs.pem
```

The command you will have just run will have extracted only the certificate
and stored it into a file called test-demo-gs.pem. You can now use openssl
to look at the contents of the certificate.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>
    openssl x509 -in ./test-demo-gs.pem -text -noout
  </Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
openssl x509 -in ./test-demo-gs.pem -text -noout
```

You will see something that looks like the following output, note the `Subject`
has the `test.demo.gs` value you requested and that the `Validity` has been
set to `72 hours`. 

```shell
 Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number:
            46:b6:ad:10:f1:3c:45:67:3a:81:06:7b:72:eb:e1:ca:0b:39:1b:ef
        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN = demo.gs
        Validity
            Not Before: Apr 12 05:31:05 2023 GMT
            Not After : Apr 15 05:31:34 2023 GMT
        Subject: CN = test.demo.gs
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (2048 bit)
```

Using this role you can generate certificates that contain any common name
as long as they are a subdomain of `demo.gs`.

## Generating restrictive certificates

Generally you do not want to have a role that is so permissive that it allows
you to generate certificates for any domain. Think about Zero Trust principles,
if one of your applications is compromised and that application has the ability
to generate certificates for any subdomain, then the attacker also has that
ability.

You should always keep the blast radius of an attack as small as possible,
if an application is compromised and the permissions it has are to only generate 
certificates for a specific domain. Then the attacker is restricted in what
they can do. In fact, they are only able to generate a certificate that is
the same as the one already available to the compromised application. 

### Challenge

Create a new role called `payments` that only allows the user the ability 
to generate certificates  for the domain `payments.demo.gs`. Ensure that 
these certificates have a maximum TTL of `24 hours`.

You can use the Vault documentation for creating pki roles for help:

Did you manage to solve the problem?

You should have run a command that looks like the following.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>
    vault write pki/roles/payments \
        allowed_domains=payments.demo.gs \
        require_cn=false \
        allow_bare_domains=true max_ttl=24h
  </Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault write pki/roles/payments \
    allowed_domains=payments.demo.gs \
    allow_bare_domains=true max_ttl=24h
```

The key difference to this role and the one that was created earlier is the
`allow_bare_domains` parameter. Where `allow_sub_domains` enable you to create
certificates for subdomains of the `allowed_domains` parameter `allow_bare_domains`
ensures that the requested domain must match exactly.
</details>

Before progressing you need to update the `payments` policy that was 
created in an earlier step to ensure that the application will be able 
to generate the required certificates. 

## Updating the payments policy

Why not have a go at adding a new `path` stanza to the `payments.hcl` file
that will enable the policy to generate secrets for the `payments` pki role.

### Challenge

Did you manage to complete this task? 

You should have added a new stanza to `payments.hcl` that looks like the
following

```javascript
path " pki/issue/payments" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
```

The full payments policy should look like the following example.

```javascript
path "kv1/payments" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "kv2/data/payments" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "database/creds/db-app" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path " pki/issue/payments" {
  capabilities = ["update"]
}
```

You should also have updated the policy in Vault using the following command:

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>
    vault policy write payments ./policy/payments.hcl
  </Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault policy write payments ./policy/payments.hcl
```

Let's now take a look at how you can provide these secrets to your applications using
Vault Agent.
