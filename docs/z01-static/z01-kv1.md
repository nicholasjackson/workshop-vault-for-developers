All secrets engines in Vault need to be mounted, this uses the following syntax:

```shell
vault secrets enable [engine specific parameters] -path=[path] [engine name]
```

## Enabling the Key Value Secrets Engine Version 1

To enable the `kv version 1 engine` you can use the following command. This
enables `version 1` of the `kv` engine and mounts it at the path `kv1`.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault secrets enable -version=1 -path=kv1 kv</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault secrets enable -version=1 -path=kv1 kv
```

You should see output like the following:

```shell
Success! Enabled the kv secrets engine at: kv1/
```

## Writing secrets

To write a secret you use the following command

```shell
vault kv put [mount path]/[secret path] [key]=[value]
```

To write a secret called `payments` to the `kv version 1` you created in an
earlier step with a key `api_key` and value `abc123`. You can use the following 
command.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv put kv1/payments api_key=abc123</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv put kv1/payments api_key=abc123
```

You should see the following output

```shell
Success! Data written to: kv1/payments
```

Secrets can contain multiple keys and values and the path is fully configurable;
for example, you may determine that you would like the path convention to be:

```shell
[team]/[application]/secret
```

And at that path you would like to create a secret called `api-keys` that 
has two keys `gateway`, and `metrics`.

To create this secret, you can use the following command:

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv put kv1/backend/payments/api-keys gateway=abc123 metrics=foobar</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv put kv1/backend/payments/api-keys gateway=abc123 metrics=foobar
```

## Reading secrets

Now you have created some secrets, let's see how you can read them. To read the secret
`payments` you can run the following command.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv get kv1/payments</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv get kv1/payments
```

You should see output that looks like the following:

```shell
===== Data =====
Key        Value
---        -----
api_key    abc123
```

Let's see how to change the output format to read this secret as `JSON`.

### Reading secrets as JSON

The Vault CLI allows you to output a secret in a number of different formats
using the optional `--format=[format]` parameter. Acceptable values for the 
parameter are:

* table - default
* json
* yaml

Let's change the output to JSON formatting:

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv get --format=json kv1/payments</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv get --format=json kv1/payments
```

You should see output that looks like the following:

```json
{
  "request_id": "aa11ec0a-03df-a5a8-69e3-8a9383fab41e",
  "lease_id": "",
  "lease_duration": 2764800,
  "renewable": false,
  "data": {
    "api_key": "abc123"
  },
  "warnings": null
}
```

JSON output allows you to easily parse the output from the Vault CLI using
tools like `jq`. For example you could use the following command to parse the
`api_key` value to the command line.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv get --format=json kv1/payments | jq -r .data.api_key</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv get --format=json kv1/payments | jq -r .data.api_key
```

## Challenge

Why not have try at outputting the value of the `gateway` key from the second secret
you created at the path `kv1/backend/payments/api-keys`.

  <VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
    <Command>vault kv get --format=json kv1/backend/payments/api-keys | jq -r .data.gateway</Command>
  </VSCodeTerminal>

  ```shell
  vault kv get --format=json kv1/backend/payments/api-keys | jq -r .data.gateway
  ```
</details>

Now you have seen how the `kv version 1` secret engine works, let's now see
how the `version 2` engine works.
