Like the `kv version 1` engine, to use the `kv version 2` secrets you first
need to mount it.

## Enabling the Key Value Secrets Engine Version 2

If you remember from the previous section the convention for mounting a secret
engine is:

```shell
vault secrets enable [engine specific parameters] -path=[path] [engine name]
```

Why not have a go at mounting the `kv version 2` engine at the path `kv2`

### Challenge

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  To enable the `kv version 2 engine` you can use the following command. This
  enables `version 2` of the `kv` engine and mounts it at the path `kv2`.

  <VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
    <Command>vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=kv2 kv</Command>
  </VSCodeTerminal>

  ```shell
  vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=kv2 kv
  ```

  You should see output like the following:

  ```shell
  Success! Enabled the kv secrets engine at: kv2/
  ```
</details>

## Configuring KV Version 2

Unlike the `version 1` engine the `version 2` engine can be configured 

### max_versions [integer]
The number of versions of a secret to keep, since a new version is created
with every `put` max versions has an impact on storage.

### cas_required [boolean]
Check and set requires that the current secret version is passed with every
`put` operation. This is to ensure that the current write is the latest.

### delete_version_after [duration]
The length of time before the keys and values of a version are removed from
the data store. Default value is 0s, versions are never automatically removed.

Let's configure the engine to set the maximum number of versions that are kept
to `3`.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault write kv2/config max_versions=3</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```
vault write kv2/config max_versions=3
```

## Writing secrets

To write a secret you use the same command as you did for the `kv version 1`,
the only difference is the path.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=abc123</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=abc123
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2023-04-10T14:04:17.66291218Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1
```

## Creating new versions

Let's create an new version

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=version2</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=version2
```

## Reading  secrets

To read a secret you can use the the same command that was used for the 
`version 1` secret engine.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv get kv2/payments</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv get kv2/payments
```

You will see that you retrieve the latest version of the secret.

```shell
======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2023-04-10T14:39:46.427848959Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            2

===== Data =====
Key        Value
---        -----
api_key    version2
```

### Retrieving a specific secret version

To retrieve a specific secret version, you only need to specify the `-version=[version]`
flag to the `get` command. Let's retrieve `version 1` of for the secret.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv get -version=1 kv2/payments</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv get -version=1 kv2/payments
```

You should see the following output

```shell
== Secret Path ==
kv2/data/payments

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2023-04-10T14:39:44.294657098Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            1

===== Data =====
Key        Value
---        -----
api_key    abc123
```

## Testing the maximum versions

To test the maximum versions configuration that you created earlier in this
example, let's create two more versions for the secret.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=version3</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=version3
```

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=version4</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv put kv2/payments api_key=version4
```

Now when you try to retrieve the `version 1` secret, you will get an error
message.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv get -version=1 kv2/payments</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv get -version=1 kv2/payments
```

```
No value found at kv2/data/payments
```

This is because the maximum number of versions that can be stored is `3` and
you have created `4` versions. To save storage Vault automatically removes
any versions of a secret over 3.

To test this, if you try to retrieve the 2nd version it will succeed.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv get -version=2 kv2/payments</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv get -version=2 kv2/payments
```

```
== Secret Path ==
kv2/data/payments

======= Metadata =======
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2023-04-10T14:39:46.427848959Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            2

===== Data =====
Key        Value
---        -----
api_key    version2
```

## Restoring secret versions

In the instance that you would like to restore a version of a secret you can
use the `kv rollback` command.

Let's restore `version 3` of the `payments` secret.

<VSCodeTerminal target="Vault">
  <Command>vault kv rollback -version=3 kv2/payments</Command>
</VSCodeTerminal>

```shell
vault kv rollback -version=3 kv2/payments
```

You will some output that looks similar to the following, note that the 
`version` has a value of `5` even though we asked for `version 3` to be 
restored. Vault always preserves history, when you roll back a secret what
you are actually doing is copying an old version to the latest version.

```
Key                Value
---                -----
created_time       2023-04-10T15:12:03.231613266Z
custom_metadata    <nil>
deletion_time      n/a
destroyed          false
version            5
```

Now you have seen how static secrets work, let's see how you can generate
dynamic database secrets.
